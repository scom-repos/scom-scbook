# SC Graph - Multi-chain data visibility


IJS Secure Compute can be leveraged for any project that wishes to make their projectâ€™s blockchain data available to 3rd parties via a standardized SCcode format.  SCRunners can index and host the data and make the data available through standard APIs. This usage scenario would be similar to The Graph.  

The main reason a project would select to build a SCcode for their project rather than creating a subgraph is that the SCcode format provides greater flexibility and long term extension possibilities.  For instance, a project initially may only want their SCcode to serve data to external entities, however, eventually, they can choose to expose additional smart contract capabilities via their SCcode to serve as a SDK endpoint.

Most blockchain projects can elect to use this usage scenario for their project.  It should be noted that projects can elect to use both a subgraph and SCcode on their project.
