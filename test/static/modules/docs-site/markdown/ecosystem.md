## SCRunners
These are the hosting resource providers that carry out the hosting of the SCcode which can be simple ‘indexed data’, SDK endpoints, or complete transactional and UX logic for a complete DApp.  SCRunners are compensated through a portion of the user fees and a portion of the IJST token inflation.
## Curators
Curators bond IJST to signal to the SCRunners, which SCcode are worth hosting.  They will also receive a portion of IJST revenue if the SCcode they signal are transacted against.
## Delegators
Delegators help secure the network by staking IJST with high performing SCRunners to gain a share of their revenue.
## Auditors
Auditors review and signoff on SCcode and receive a portion of the revenue and inflation to support their services.
