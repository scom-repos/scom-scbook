# What is IJS Secure Compute?

IJS Secure Compute is a DApp runtime protocol that enables decentralized processing of transactions with smart contracts and multi-chain interaction.  Secure Compute enables anyone to build and publish an SDK or a fully functioning DApp through a decentralized network of run-time hosts called SCRunners.  By adhering to an open format called SCcode, smart contract interaction can be made easy and secure.

IJS Secure Compute is designed to benefit DApps in the following ways:
- Easily query and transact against smart contracts from various chains
- Hosted in a trustless decentralized manner
- Faster to build
- Authenticity of DApps to address ‘fake’ site concerns
